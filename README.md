Mocks out Redux actions and selectors for clean React unit tests in Jest.

Use this package if you'd like your React compnent unit tests to not take dependencies on your full Redux states.
Separating your unit tests in this way can be particularly useful if your Redux state is complex and/or shared across components.

## Usage

```js
import { mockRedux } from "mock-redux";
```

`mock-redux` stubs out the [two common Redux hooks](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks) used with functional React components.
Call `mockRedux()` before your render/mount logic in each unit test.

### Mocking State

```tsx
mockRedux().state({
  /* ... */
});
```

Sets a root state to be passed to your component's selectors.

```tsx
it("displays the title when there is a title", () => {
  mockRedux().state({
    title: "Hooray!",
  });

  // state => state.title
  const view = render(<RendersTitle />);

  view.getByText("Hooray!");
});
```

See [Selectors](./docs/Selectors.md) for more documentation or [Heading](./docs/examples/Heading.test.tsx) for a code example.

### Mocking Selectors

```tsx
mockRedux()
  .give(simpleSelector, "Always!")
  .giveMock(fancySelector, jest.fn().mockReturnValueOnce("Just the once."));
```

Provide results to the [`useSelector`](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks#useselector) function for individual selectors passed to it.
These work similarly to Jest mocks: `.give` takes in the return value that will always be passed to the selector.

```tsx
it("displays the title when there is a title", () => {
  mockRedux().give(selectTitle, "Hooray!");

  // state => state.title
  const view = render(<RendersTitle />);

  view.getByText("Hooray!");
});
```

If you'd like more control over the return values, you can use `.giveMock` to provide a [Jest mock](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-functions.html).

See [Selectors](./docs/Selectors.md) for more documentation or [Heading](./docs/examples/Heading.test.tsx) for a code example.

### Dispatch Spies

```tsx
const { dispatch } = mockRedux();
```

The `dispatch` function returned by [`useDispatch`](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks#usedispatch) will be replaced by a `jest.fn()` spy.
You can then assert against it as with any Jest mock in your unit tests:

```tsx
it("dispatches the pageLoaded action when rendered", () => {
  const { dispatch } = mockRedux();

  // dispatch(pageLoaded())
  render(<DispatchesPageLoaded />);

  expect(dispatch).toHaveBeenCalledWith(pageLoaded());
});
```

See [Dispatches](./docs/Dispatches.md) for more documentation or [Clicker](./docs/examples/Clicker.test.tsx) for a code example.

## Gotchas

- Only named selector functions directly passed to `useSelector` are supported.
  - See [#6](https://github.com/Codecademy/mock-redux/issues/6) for discussion on allowing inline lambdas such as `useSelector(state => state.value)`.
- If a selector is passed to `useSelector` without having a `.give` or `.giveMock` previuosly declared for it, `mock-redux` will throw an error.
- The first `mock-redux` import _must_ come before the first `react-redux` import in your test files.

### Hybrid Usage

You don't have to use `mock-redux` in _every_ unit test file in your repository.
Only the test files that import `mock-redux` will have Redux actions stubbed out.

### TypeScript Usage

`mock-redux` is written in TypeScript and generally type safe.

- `.give` return values must match the return types of their selectors.
- `.giveMock` mocks must match the return types of their selectors.

_Heck yes._
