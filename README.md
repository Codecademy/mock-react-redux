Mocks out Redux actions and selectors for clean React Jest tests.

Tired of setting up, updating, and debugging through complex _Redux_ states in your _React_ tests?
Use this package if you'd like your React component tests to not take dependencies on your full Redux store.

> See [FAQs](./docs/FAQs.md) for more backing information. ðŸ“š

## Usage

```js
import { mockRedux } from "mock-redux";
```

`mock-redux` stubs out [`connect`](https://react-redux.js.org/api/connect) and the [two common Redux hooks](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks) used with React components.
Call `mockRedux()` before your render/mount logic in each test.

### Mocking State

```tsx
mockRedux().state({
  title: "Hooray!",
});
```

Sets a root state to be passed to your component's selectors.

```tsx
it("displays the title when there is a title", () => {
  mockRedux().state({
    title: "Hooray!",
  });

  // state => state.title
  const view = render(<RendersTitle />);

  view.getByText("Hooray!");
});
```

See [Selectors](./docs/Selectors.md) for more documentation or [Heading](./docs/examples/Heading.test.tsx) for a code example.

### Mocking Selectors

```tsx
mockRedux()
  .give(simpleSelector, "Hooray!")
  .giveMock(fancySelector, jest.fn().mockReturnValueOnce("Just the once."));
```

Provide results to the [`useSelector`](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks#useselector) function for individual selectors passed to it.
These work similarly to Jest mocks: `.give` takes in the return value that will always be passed to the selector.

```tsx
it("displays the title when there is a title", () => {
  mockRedux().give(selectTitle, "Hooray!");

  // state => state.title
  const view = render(<RendersTitle />);

  view.getByText("Hooray!");
});
```

If you'd like more control over the return values, you can use `.giveMock` to provide a [Jest mock](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-functions.html).

See [Selectors](./docs/Selectors.md) for more documentation or [Heading](./docs/examples/Heading.test.tsx) for a code example.

### Dispatch Spies

```tsx
const { dispatch } = mockRedux();
```

The `dispatch` function returned by [`useDispatch`](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks#usedispatch) will be replaced by a `jest.fn()` spy.
You can then assert against it as with any Jest mock in your tests:

```tsx
it("dispatches the pageLoaded action when rendered", () => {
  const { dispatch } = mockRedux();

  // dispatch(pageLoaded())
  render(<DispatchesPageLoaded />);

  expect(dispatch).toHaveBeenCalledWith(pageLoaded());
});
```

See [Dispatches](./docs/Dispatches.md) for more documentation or [Clicker](./docs/examples/Clicker.test.tsx) for a code example.

## Gotchas

- The first `mock-redux` import _must_ come before the first `react-redux` import in your test files.
- `.give` and `.giveMock` will only apply when selectors are passed directly to `useSelector` (e.g. `useSelector(selectValue)`).
  - For inline selectors such as `useSelector(state => selectValue(state))`, use the `.state` API to set the root state value.

### Hybrid Usage

You don't have to use `mock-redux` in _every_ test file in your repository.
Only the test files that import `mock-redux` will have Redux actions stubbed out.

### TypeScript Usage

`mock-redux` is written in TypeScript and generally type safe.

- `mockRedux()` has an optional `<State>` type which sets the type of the root state passed to `.state`.
- `.give` return values must match the return types of their selectors.
- `.giveMock` mocks must match the return types of their selectors.

_Heck yes._ ðŸ¤˜
